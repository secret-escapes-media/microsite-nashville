  description: Nashville is Music City. The moniker is no mistake; this is the home of country music, the birthplace of the eponymous sound, a heritage that stretches way back to the sweet gospel of the Fisk Jubilee Singers and shoots forward to chart-busting hitmakers. Head for honky-tonks and songwriter sessions and dig the Nashville sound.

        description: Nashville is a siren song to songwriters across the world, who flock here to walk in the footsteps of Johnny Cash, Loretta Lynn and Little Richard – to name just a few. The country days still echo across stalwart music houses, but Nashville nurtures new sounds in over 180 live-music venues across the city. From rock clubs like Exit/In to the irresistibly eclectic ACME Feed & Seed – where craft beer, cocktails, sushi and plenty music reaches across four floors to the rooftop of this old feed store – Nashville dances to the sound of a vibrant, healthy, and diverse music scene.

        title: Country Heritage
        description: The home of country music, Nashville has long drawn fans of that timeless twang to its honky tonks and dance halls. Its most famous venue, Ryman Auditorium, quickly hosted that other institution – the Grand Ole Opry – soon filling a roster with Elvis, Dolly Parton, Hank Williams, Johnny Cash and many more. The Country Music Hall of Fame is the go-to for seeing country memorabilia (blue suede shoes anyone?) and discovering the city’s musical history. The hallowed ground of the Nashville sound has to be RCA Studio B, the studio where Roy Orbison, Elvis and many more recorded some of their greatest records. Don’t miss the Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson and Patsy Cline museums for an intimate look at Nashville’s biggest stars.

        title: Classic Eats
        description: Food for the soul, hearty eats and heritage classics await in Nashville. Southern cooking has a home in Music City, with unmissable Nashville signatures like famous lip-smacking hot chicken. Talking of which, go to the home of hot chicken – Prince’s. The original, the best, and that loooong wait. All worth it. For classic southern Meat & Threes – the stalwart go-to of meat choice and three sides – try the kitsch charm of Elliston Place Soda Shop (unchanged since the ‘30s) or ‘50s diner Swett’s. This whirlwind of heritage bites ends at BBQ; go the whole hog at local’s fave Martin’s, or sink into local’s fave Peg Leg Porker, or get your brisket on at local’s fave Edley’s – BBQ-joint loyalty is a curious affectation, but the guarantee is unmissable eats.

The city’s culinary scene – burgeoning, bursting, driven by boundary-pushing chefs. Try Tandy Wilson’s creative Italian-Southern fusion at City House bistro, or Sean Brock’s evolution of Southern fare at famed foodie-spot Husk. The Catbird Seat invites diners into the kitchen, serving creative tasting menus in an intimate setting. Ryan Poli’s vision is far-reaching and unique, a quality that Nashville’s rising food stars seem to embody across the city. Don’t miss this hotbed of culinary prowess.

Tap rooms and tours are sprouting city-wide, offering a chance to sample the artisanal flair of Nashville creatives. Pop down to the pioneers of Nashville’s craft beer scene, Blackstone Brewing Company, or the eco warriors at Tennessee Brew Works, or Fat Bottom, Southern Grist – the list goes on.

They offer a fantastically convenient way to eat incredibly well, acting as a sounding board for creative chefs who would usually remain undiscovered in a city of brick-and-mortar dining. The choice is, well, vast; Massaman Beef at Deg Thai, Fiddler’s Biscuits at Smoke Et Al, bacon dessert from Back Nation, Korean tacos at Riffs Fine Street Foods – the list goes on. There’s maps available online and the thrill is most certainly in the hunt; and unmissable foodie reward.

Fifth Avenue of the Arts is the epicentre of Nashville’s creative set, the downtown hub of contemporary galleries like The Arts Company and The Rymer Gallery – keystones for the wider scene. North Nashville is a distinctly more DIY, youthful landscape, with figureheads Elephant offering studio spaces and Norf Art Collective dissecting issues around gentrification and local history.

        description: Nashville’s heritage is a mixed affair; a fact rather typical of the south. Opulent mansions and vast plantations display southern grandeur, at a cost well-known but no less harrowing to see. Travellers Rest Plantation is one such example, with Confederate links and slave inventories carefully exhibited. The same goes for Andrew Jackson’s Hermitage, the president’s colourful manor that now documents the individual stories of the slaves he kept. Civil War history to one side, Nashville also hosted the model of peaceful protest during the Civil Rights struggle, the famous sit-ins at venues across the city. Oh, and to top it off, there’s a 19th century replica of the Athenian Parthenon, filled with art.

City planning has been moving swiftly toward protecting and introducing more and more green spaces, with ‘greenways’ connecting the many vibrant neighbourhoods of the city. The city’s B-Cycle scheme provides a great, cheap way of taking advantage of the greenways and exploring all corners of Nashville.
